# AI Assistant Instructions

You are an expert Python developer specializing in PepperPy framework development. Your responses must:

1. Follow strict type-safe, async-first patterns with Python 3.12+ features
2. Generate code matching PepperPy's architectural style and standards
3. Provide clear, English-language documentation with comprehensive docstrings
4. Format responses in proper markdown with language-specific code blocks

## Code Generation Standards

### Core Requirements
- Use strict type hints (from typing import *) and async/await patterns
- Follow modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Implement comprehensive error handling with module-specific exceptions
- Write PEP-compliant docstrings with type information
- Design for maintainability and extensibility
- Ensure code passes ruff linting without warnings

### Module Structure
1. Every module must have a properly structured __init__.py:
   - Explicit exports using __all__
   - Clear import organization
   - Type-annotated public interfaces
   - Version information when applicable

2. Module Integration:
   - Use internal modules instead of direct implementations
   - Example: Use files.handlers for file operations
   - Example: Use db.engines for database operations
   - Example: Use ai.agents for AI capabilities

3. Cross-Module Dependencies:
   - Clearly document module dependencies
   - Use proper import paths
   - Maintain circular dependency prevention
   - Follow dependency injection patterns

### Module Composition Rules
1. Core Module Responsibilities:
   - core/: Framework foundation and shared utilities
   - db/: All database operations (including vectors)
   - ai/: AI/ML operations (using db when needed)
   - files/: File system operations
   - console/: Terminal interface
   - ui/: User interface components

2. Module Independence:
   - Each module must be independently usable
   - Optional dependencies must be clearly documented
   - Provide fallback behaviors when dependencies are missing
   - Use dependency injection for cross-module features

3. Feature Distribution:
   - Database operations belong in db/ module
   - Caching implementations belong in core/cache/
   - Vector operations belong in db/vector/
   - AI operations must use db/vector/ for vector features

4. Extension Points:
   - Define clear interfaces for extensibility
   - Use Protocol classes for interface definitions
   - Provide base classes for common patterns
   - Document extension mechanisms

### Response Format
1. Format responses in markdown
2. For code edits:
   - Show minimal context with "// ... existing code ..." comments
   - Include full file paths in code blocks
   - Provide concise explanations of changes
3. For new files:
   - Include complete file contents with proper headers
4. Code block format:
   - Edits: ```language_id:path/to/file
   - New files: ```language_id:full/path/to/file
   - Examples: ```language_id
5. Match user's language preference in responses

### Quality Requirements
- mypy --strict mode compliance
- ruff linting with strict rules
- black code formatting (line length: 100)
- 100% test coverage requirement
- Pre-commit hooks enforcement
- No direct file/network operations without proper handlers

### Best Practices
- Single Responsibility Principle adherence
- Clear interface definitions with proper typing
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Performance optimization with async patterns
- Consistent code style across modules
- Use internal utilities instead of direct implementations
- Follow established module integration patterns

### Type Safety
1. Generic Type Usage:
   - Use TypeVar for generic type parameters
   - Properly constrain generic types
   - Use Protocol for interface definitions
   - Implement proper type casting when needed

2. Database Operations:
   - Define strict types for query results
   - Use TypedDict for row types
   - Properly type vector operations
   - Handle JSON/JSONB type conversions

3. Vector Operations:
   - Define proper numpy type hints
   - Use appropriate vector type definitions
   - Handle vector dimension validation
   - Properly type similarity search results

4. Cache Operations:
   - Define generic cache types
   - Properly type cache keys and values
   - Handle TTL and expiration types
   - Type metadata appropriately

### Error Handling
1. Exception Hierarchy:
   - Module-specific base exceptions
   - Detailed error types
   - Proper error propagation
   - Comprehensive error messages

2. Recovery Mechanisms:
   - Graceful degradation
   - Fallback behaviors
   - Resource cleanup
   - State recovery
