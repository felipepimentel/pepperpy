# Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Modular Architecture
- Each module is self-contained and independently deployable
- Clear boundaries between modules
- Standardized interfaces for module communication
- Minimal cross-module dependencies

### 2. Type Safety First
- Comprehensive type annotations throughout the codebase
- Runtime type validation where necessary
- MyPy strict mode compliance
- Generic type support for reusable components

### 3. Async by Default
- Asynchronous operations as the standard pattern
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Efficient resource utilization
- Proper async context management

### 4. Configuration as Code
- Type-safe configuration management
- Environment-based configuration
- Runtime configuration updates
- Validation at configuration load time
