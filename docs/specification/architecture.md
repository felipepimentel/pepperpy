# PepperPy Architecture

## Overview

PepperPy follows a modular, event-driven architecture designed for flexibility and extensibility. The framework is built around the concept of independent modules that communicate through a well-defined registry system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Modular Design
- Each module is self-contained and independently deployable
- Modules communicate through standardized interfaces
- Clear separation of concerns between modules

### 2. Async-First Architecture
- Built on Python's asyncio framework
- Non-blocking operations by default
- Efficient handling of concurrent operations

### 3. Type Safety
- Comprehensive type annotations
- Static type checking with mypy
- Runtime type validation where necessary

## System Components

### Core Layer
- **Registry**: Central module management and dependency injection
- **Configuration**: Global and module-specific configuration management
- **Utils**: Shared utilities and helper functions

### Module Layer
- **UI Module**: User interface components and rendering
- **Console Module**: Terminal-based interface and interactions
- **AI Module**: Artificial intelligence and agent management
